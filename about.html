		<h2>The startup shown above is going to fail.</h2>

		<p>I know this because somebody hired the old dude in the top left corner.  The rest of the team is chilling, hacking, BBM-ing, scoping tail, whatever.  But the photobomber
		is on edge.  He's killing everyone's vibe.  Pretty soon, he'll kill your business model, too.  Next thing you know you're pivoting
		like Kobe when the Mavs put on their fullcourt press.  God, I've seen it a million times.
		You should have listened to me when I told you to <b>never hire old dudes</b>.

		<p>It's little bits of knowledge like this that I pass on to the companies I invest in.  Perhaps you've heard of some of my portfolio
		companies: Twitter, Twitpic, Quikster, Friendster, Catster, Dogster, and Hamsterster.  Either way, none of this matters.
		What does matter is that you, the non-technical co-founder of a soon-to-be-very-profitable-and-by-that-i-mean-never-profitable startup, heed my advice.  I've been in this business for
		a long time, kid.  It's about time you realize that you might not know everything.  And that I do.  Because I am a venture capital superstar.</p>

		<p>So read my posts, re-tweet my tweets, and
		find my at the next New York City Startup event - it would be my pleasure to tell you why your business model sucks.
