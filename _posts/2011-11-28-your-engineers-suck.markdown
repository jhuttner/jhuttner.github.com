title: Your engineers suck, and so do their t-shirts.

You might as well start calling yourself General Eisenhower because you're storming retailers' front offices like it's Normandy in June of `44.  You've spent all morning in the trenches, running across Manhattan pitching your location-based mobile advertising platform to local businesses like Starbucks, McDonald's, and Outback Steakhouse.  "It's like Groupon, but in reverse," you tell them.  And since Groupon is the most valuable company in the history of Earth, everyone seems to understand that the reverse of it will likely be even bigger.  In other words, you're a shoe-in for the Startup Purple Heart - the award given to the non-technical co-founder who will stop at nothing to get verbal agreements from small business owners to have coffee with him once his company actually launches a product.

On the theme of launching a product, you still haven't launched a product.  But, to your credit, you're working hard with your engineers to make it happen.  In fact, you've just jetted across Times Square, dodging Grandmas and Japanese tourists singing the Lion King overture, and swooped into your Ninth Avenue office in time for your twice-weekly sync-up with your technical lead, Tommy.

When you arrive, Tommy cables his laptop up to the projector and fires up his virtual machine.  Then he gets into what his team has accomplished since last week:


1.  Form elements are now being rendered using Twitter's "Bootstap" templates, so the buttons have hover states: gray... to blue... to gray.  

2.  The registration workflow has been completely overhauled.  Users can now authenticate using oAuth, Facebook, their Gravatar, or a promotional code that is given out at Chuckie Cheese franchises in Dover, Delaware.

3.  Bugs Killed: stylesheets are now rendering properly in Opera, and that image flicker in IE8 has disappeared, but no one is quite sure why.

This all sounds good, but the app basically looks the same as it did a week ago.  The only difference is that $10,000 has been sucked out of the business towards salaries, rent, and Bolthouse Farms Vanilla Chai Tea beverages.  At this burn rate, you only have five more weeks until you have to ask your Dad to finance another angel round. Ever worse, you'll dilute again (though Dad did say you could have all his equity so this is a somewhat moot point).  Regardless, you decide it's time to get some answers from your techical lead:

"Tommy, are we any closer to actually releasing the product?"

"Hrmm, I'd say were still about a month out. We need to refactor our markdown templates, but once that's worked out, we're down the home stretch: choose a NoSQL solution, and integrate it with Square."

"What's Square?"

"Square is our payment platform.  It's like PayPal but no one uses it, so we're going to go with it. We discussed this last week."

Oh right.  You did discuss this last week.  But nevermind getting paid.  The timeframe is what demands your attention.  Tommy said the app is still one month from being able to ship.  One month would not sound so bad if he hadn't told you one month ago that the app would be done by now.

"What are my engineers doing?" you wonder.  "If Vince Lombardi were managing these guys, could he get them to ship?"

<i>Reflection</i>.  You take a look at your engineering squad: Tommy, Alex, Arjun, and Dan.  Four dudes who seemed like such great devs when you hired them, but now seem like not-such-great devs.  You look them up and down once more, and then you realize something:

<big><big><i><b>Their t-shirts suck.</b></i></big></big>  

Their t-shirts suck! They are not funny.  They don't joke about math.  They lack sexual innuendo.  Heck, they aren't even wearing 50/50 blends.  As you think back, you realize that these guys never wore awesome t-shirts.  In fact, in the summer they rocked polos.  No wonder they suck at coding.  You were down at Mongo's offices yesterday and their engineers' t-shirts rocked... the house.  No wonder Mongo ships product like a logistics company.  Here's what they were donning:

"Sudo make me a sandwich."  Brilliant. Who is Sudo anyway?  Doesn't matter.

"Iceberg Ahead" with a picture of some lettuce and a boat.  I'm speechless.

Two guys wearing shirts that say, "Your Mom Says Hi.  JINX!".  That Lonely Island video is only, like, a month old.  Talk about turnaround.

You really missed the boat on this one.  You hired engineers who wear crappy t-shirts.  Of course they write crappy code and build crappy webapps.  By now you know that you really have no choice.  You have to fire your engineers.  You have to get back out to those job fairs.  And you have to hire another four engineers.  (In that order, of course.)  Only this time you won't be grading them on the basis of how fast they can reverse a linked-list.  Oh no.  This time you're honing in on the only quality that matters: the hilarity, douchebaggery, and political incorrectedness of their t-shirts.  Correct: this means that "There are two types of people in the world..." is more stale than Minnestrone soup at Pret. 

Luckily, this chef knows what's fresh.  Here are some t-shirt designs guaranteed to hug the pecs of developers who can turn your business idea into a shippable webapp in no time:

Finding engineers who rock these tees harder than Kurt Cobain is not going to be easy, but when you do find them, hit 'em with the big equity package and they'll have you shipped faster than FedEx Priority Overnight.  Let me know how it works out for you.
